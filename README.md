# Neural-network-implementation
In this project I implemented a neural network classifier from scracth, Using only numpy.<br>
After the implemention I trained the network to classify hand written digits based on the MNIST large database of handwritten digits.<br>
Finally I compared its performence to the built in Sklearn MLP model, and even recived higher accurecy then the Sklearn MLP model(95% VS 83.4%).<br>
